# Single command

- STATE: CLOSED
- PRIORITY: 50
- TAGS: ux

Currently, we have multiple commands:
- TasksNew
- TasksCreateFromTODO
- TasksQfBacklinks
- etc.

We have **7** as of writing (Sat Feb  7 17:53:58 CET 2026). I want to cut down
to just one, where we accept a subcommand for each existing command, ideally
with autocompletion.
